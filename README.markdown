WindowMover
===========

WindowMover is a simple utility that moves the active window from one screen to another.  If you use multiple screens with your Mac, this was designed for you.

With a keystroke, you can quickly move the current window to any screen.  Personally, I use this to quickly move windows to or from my primary display which sits right in front of me, to my secondary screen just to the right.

Installation
------------
You have to compile and install this by hand right now.  You'll first need to install [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/InstallingMacRuby), and then build in Xcode 3.1.
